                    <p>Redman is a silly fighting game where the player
                        fights countless enemies. I designed it from scratch using Godot,
                        as well as the visuals and music. I focused on making the enemies
                        act naturally. The player also locks on to the nearest enemy for better controls.

                    <p>I made a full stack MERN app. Unlike many beginners who clone entire tutorials, I planned out what I wanted to do 
                        and pieced everything together. In this project, I learned how to build a REST API, connect React and Node JS, 
                        implement a simple login, add/remove content, use pagination to improve the UI, and many more. I deployed my app using Heroku —

                    <p>Graph theory and pathfinding algorithms were one of the big things
                    I learned about during my 1st year into CS, and I always wanted to implement
                    it myself. This simulation can draw paths slowly for better visualization.
                     I wrote my own simple graph class and UI with the help of Godot, and
                    coded in 4 different pathfinding algorithms.

                        ever with the help of some friends. I always felt disconnected from my culture after
                        being in the US for many years, so I decided to get everyone together. We were

                    <p>I wanted to use this as an opportunity to get familiar with responsive web design,

                        manner. I used HTML/CSS/JS(some jQuery)
                        and set up my contact form with Firebase.
